Project Euler #11
-----------------

My solution for Project Euler problem #11 (https://projecteuler.net/problem=11) using Python.
`euler.py` is the main file containing solution for the problem. `tests.py` includes tests for the app.


Requirements
-------------

* Python 2.7 or 3.4 (https://www.python.org/)


Running the app
---------------

* Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/joni-/euler11.git)`) or just copy the `euler11.py` to your computer.
* Run the app and give a file containing the grid as a parameter (`python3 euler11.py input`).
* The app prints the solution for the problem into console
